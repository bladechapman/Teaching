    - How do we store values for later?
    - How do we make variables?
    - How do we use variables?
        - Distinction between a function, a number, etc.
* Functions
    - How do we make functions without parameters? With parameters?
    - Why do we make functions?
    - How do we make functions?
* Control Flow

        - How do you make an if statement?
        - How do you make an else statement?
        - How do you compose the two to make an if else statement?
* Exercises
    1. Open up the console in Chrome
    2. If I was born in 1995, how old am I? Can you find out? (Values)
    3. Can you make a function to figure out how old I am given any year? (Functions)
    4. Can you figure out how old I am based on the day? The month? (Conditionals)
    5. Make the snake grow
        - Can you make an Apple and draw it on the board?
        - Can you make the snake grow?
        - Can you make the snake grow if it touches the Apple?
        - Can you make a new Apple in a new place after the snake eats it?
    6. Make the game end when it touches the border
        - Can you figure out where the snake is?
        - Can you figure out when the snake reaches the edge?
        - Can you restart the game once it’s over?
    

### New Material
* Data Structures
    - Arrays
        - Arrays can hold collections of values
        - In Javascript, arrays can hold any combination of things. This is not necessarily true in other languages
        - You can do things like figure out the length of an array, put an item into an array, or read an item from an array
    - Loops
        - You can use loops to iterate through arrays
    - Hashes
        - While arrays are numerically indexed, hashes are name indexed
        - Hashes let us find things really easily
        - Hashes don’t guarantee us an order like arrays do
* Exercises
    - Can you make more than one Apple appear on the board?
    - How do you figure out which Apple the snake has eaten?

### Homework
* Can you keep track of how many Apples the snake has eaten?
* Can you make a special Apple that grows the snake twice?
